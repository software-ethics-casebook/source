In the aftermath of a 2015 mass shooting in San Bernardino, CA, police sought evidence that the shooter had information on his phone about prior contacts with some of the people killed. The U.S. FBI were granted a search warrant of the shooter’s phone, but were unable to access the phone due to the lock mechanism. The Department of Justice then filed a motion in court to order Apple to produce a firmware update that would disable the exponential back-off as described; Apple responded by refusing to cooperate with the request, and the Department of Justice eventually dropped the motion.
